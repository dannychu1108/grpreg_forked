Description: Efficient algorithms for fitting the regularization path of linear
  regression, GLM, and Cox regression models with grouped penalties.  This
  includes group selection methods such as group lasso, group MCP, and
  group SCAD as well as bi-level selection methods such as the group
  exponential lasso, the composite MCP, and the group bridge.
